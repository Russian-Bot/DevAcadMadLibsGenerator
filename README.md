## Mad Libs Generator

### Project Brief

Inspired by Summer Son’s Mad Libs project with Javascript. The program will first prompt the
user for a series of inputs a la Mad Libs. For example, a singular noun, an adjective, etc. Then,
once all the information has been inputted, the program will take that data and place them into a
premade story template. You’ll need prompts for user input, and to then print out the full story at
the end with the input included.

### Concepts to keep in mind:
- Strings
- Variables
- Concatenation
- Print

### Deliverables
A pretty fun beginning project that gets you thinking about how to manipulate user inputted data.
Compared to the prior projects, this project focuses far more on strings and concatenating.
Have some fun coming up with some wacky stories for this!

### Solution
Create a number of random selections of text that can be knitted together by the user inputs, so many stories are possible

### Technicals
Populate 1D lists with snippets of text to knit together the user input.
Prompt for user input of a noun, adverb and verb. Randomly select pieces of text from each of the lists and display it.
Always allow the user to exit if they want to.
